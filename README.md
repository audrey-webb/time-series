### Objective 
Examining if the sales at health and personal care stores in the United States follows a seasonal pattern. By examining this data, my hopes are it will indicate future growth, showing that there is high demand and economic value in health and personal care stores, and aid stores in  identifying and measuring seasonal variations within their market to help them plan for the future.

Health and personal care stores make prescriptions drugs and other health-related products readily available to the public. In-store pharmacies, which account for about 67% of total sales, are in demand with over 3.4 billion retail prescriptions being filled nationally since 2005 and have resulted in more patient-pharmacist interaction. Improving upon this relationship, as well as understanding drug sales and spending, will lead to an assessment of how best to lower healthcare costs as well as improve quality of life.
